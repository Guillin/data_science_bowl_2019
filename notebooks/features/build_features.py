# ### Fix num correct and incorrect variables 
#  [markdown]
# geting from data-science-bowl-2019-data-exploration
#  [markdown]
# From Kaggle: The file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. Assessment attempts are captured in event_code 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses event_code 4110. If the attempt was correct, it contains "correct":true.
# 
# However, in the first version I already noticed that I had one attempt too many for this installation_id when mapping the rows with the train_labels for. It turns out that there are in fact also assessment attemps for Bird Measurer with event_code 4100, which should not count (see below). In this case that also makes sense as this installation_id already had a pass on the first attempt
